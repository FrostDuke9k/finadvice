# Conceptual Python code for a UK Finance & Tax Law Monitoring Agent
#
# IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS:
# 1. This is a highly simplified conceptual illustration, NOT a production-ready system.
# 2. Real-world financial advice and law monitoring require deep domain expertise,
#    robust NLP/AI capabilities, and strict adherence to legal/regulatory standards (e.g., FCA in the UK).
# 3. Error handling, security, scalability, and actual AI model integration are complex
#    topics not fully addressed in this basic example.
# 4. Always consult with legal, financial, and AI professionals before developing
#    or deploying such a system.
#
# Potential libraries you might need (add to your requirements.txt):
# requests
# beautifulsoup4
# nltk (or spaCy, or other NLP libraries)
# scikit-learn (for more advanced change detection or classification)
# A database library (e.g., SQLAlchemy for SQL, or a NoSQL client)
# A web framework (e.g., Flask, Django)
# A task queue (e.g., Celery for background monitoring)

# --- Notes on Web Integration (e.g., with Flask) ---
"""
How this agent could integrate with a Python web application (e.g., Flask/Django):

1.  Background Task:
    The `agent.check_for_updates()` method would not run directly within a web request.
    It would be scheduled as a background task using something like:
    - Celery: A powerful distributed task queue. You'd define a Celery task that calls `check_for_updates()`.
              Celery Beat would schedule this task to run periodically (e.g., daily, hourly).
    - APScheduler: A Python library for in-process scheduling.
    - System cron job: A simple OS-level scheduler that runs a Python script.

2.  Database for Changes:
    The `detected_changes` and `last_known_state` should be stored in a proper database
    (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB) instead of a JSON file.
    - Your web application would then query this database to display recent changes to administrators
      or to inform the financial advice algorithms.

3.  API Endpoints (Flask Example Snippet):
    You might have Flask routes to:
    - View the status of the agent.
    - See the latest detected changes.
    - Manually trigger a check (for admin purposes).

    ```python
    # --- Flask App Example (Conceptual - app.py) ---
    # from flask import Flask, jsonify
    # from your_agent_module import LawMonitorAgent, OFFICIAL_SOURCES # Assuming agent is in another file
    # import threading

    # app = Flask(__name__)
    # agent = LawMonitorAgent(OFFICIAL_SOURCES) # Initialize agent

    # # This is a simplified way to run the agent in the background for a demo.
    # # For production, use Celery or similar.
    # def run_agent_periodically():
    #     while True:
    #         agent.check_for_updates()
    #         time.sleep(3600) # Check every hour

    # if __name__ != '__main__': # To avoid running this when Flask reloads during development
    #    # In a real app, you'd use a proper task queue.
    #    # For a very simple demo, you could run it in a separate thread,
    #    # but this is not robust for production.
    #    # agent_thread = threading.Thread(target=run_agent_periodically, daemon=True)
    #    # agent_thread.start()
    #    pass


    # @app.route('/api/law-changes', methods=['GET'])
    # def get_law_changes():
    #     # This would query the database where the agent stores changes
    #     # For now, let's imagine it can access the agent's last detected changes (not ideal for real app)
    #     # This is just illustrative; direct access to agent state from web request is not best practice.
    #     # You'd typically read from a shared database.
    #     # changes = agent.get_latest_changes_from_db() # Ideal
    #     # return jsonify(changes)
    #     return jsonify({"message": "Endpoint to get law changes from DB - Implement DB query"})

    # @app.route('/api/agent-status', methods=['GET'])
    # def agent_status():
    #     # This would query the agent's status from the DB or a status file
    #     # last_run = agent.get_last_run_time_from_db() # Ideal
    #     # return jsonify({"status": "running", "last_check": last_run})
    #     return jsonify({"message": "Endpoint for agent status - Implement DB query"})

    # if __name__ == '__main__':
    #    # app.run(debug=True) # Run the Flask development server
    #    # To run the agent and Flask app, you'd typically run them as separate processes
    #    # or use a proper setup like Gunicorn + Celery.
    #    print("This conceptual Flask app would run separately from the agent's main loop.")
    #    print("The agent's main loop (if __name__ == '__main__') is for standalone testing.")
